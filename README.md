1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

<b>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29373563/audiocontext-on-safari</b>

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

<b>One challenge I encountered was being unable to get the buttons to play a sound in Safari. Initially, I double-checked that the code given to me relating to sound was correct.
Since that was all correct, I looked up the error that was presented in the console to try and debug the issue. The website above showed me that not all browsers support the AudioContext feature,
so I tried another browser; however, Google Chrome also presented the same issue. I then tried Firefox which was able to play the sound.

When I was working on the 3 strikes portion, I first just increased the counter and added the check into my code. However, This made the
game stop because the pattern would not display again. I realized this, and added the playClueSequence() function after updating the strikeCounter
so that the sequence would play again after the strike. </b>

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

<b>Is this the usual process for creating a web development project? What additional steps should we take?<br><br>
Are there different types of web developers working on specific aspects of the website? Like, the style, the index.html file, the javascript portion, etc.<br><br>
What is the best way to learn how to develop on the web? Pratice, pratice, practice, I assume? Any tips or tricks?<br><br>
What do web developers do when they get stuck on a particular feature?<br><br>
How is web development different from software development? And, what particular skills do you need for each?</b>

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

<b>If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would implement the random generator so that the pattern would change every time. This would allow the same person to
play multiple times without memorizing the pattern. I would also want to try having my program start the pattern again with each strike. I believe this would make the game more interesting
because the user will be watching carefully so that they do not have to start over. I would also like to make the overall appearance of the game more appealing to the eye.

One thing I would like to implement that was not one of the options is to add a visual for the decreasing counter so that the user is aware how many lives they have left.
Another thing that would be cool is to add levels which adds another game button every time the user finishes the current pattern. This may be an excellent challenge because
many different functions will need to be changed when the new button is added and a new pattern needs to incorporate the new button.</b>
